# 약이지(yakeasy)
Purely Swift/SwiftUI based iOS app that fetches information about commercially available medicine sold in South Korea from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. I wanted to try making my first app over the summer holidays, so it is crudly made within the time constraint of about 1 month. 

# Future of this project
I don't think I could continue working on this particular app in the forseeable future due to time constraints with coursework and and the limitations of the government database this app fetches data from.
